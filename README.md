# DES-Decrypting

This repository is a collaboration with [Niccol√≤ Biondi](https://github.com/NiccoBiondi) as the mid-term project for the [Parallel Computing](https://www.unifi.it/p-ins2-2015-415640-0.html) exam at the University of Florence. The mid-term project, DES-decrypting, can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/giuliobz/DES-Decrypting).

Here we propose our solutions for the des-Decrypting task. In particular, we study the CPU parallelism, through Java Thread implementations. We compare those performances with a sequential method and we evaluate the resulting Speed Up and Efficiency.

For more theorical details of our project please refers to the review(**IN PROGRESS**) and our presentation(**TODO**) in the `docs/`(**TODO**) subdirectory.

## Reproduce experiments

### Install  the repository

* `$ git clone https://github.com/giuliobz/DES-Decrypting.git`
* `$ cd DES-Decrypting-master`

### Create the Database

To crete the dictionary use the file [PasswordBuilder](src/PasswordDictionary/PasswordBuilder.java) and specify three arguments:

- the starting dictionary to modify
- file name to save the password dictionary
- method used: **data** to ceate a Dictionary of birth date or **words** to create a Dictionary of words


### Run the experiments

Inside the DES-Decrypting folder there is a script.sh that the user can use to reproduce the experiments made:

* `$ cd DES-Decrypting-master`
* `$ chmode a+x script.sh`
* `$ ./script.sh`
